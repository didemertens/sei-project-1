# Frogger Game
This a version of the game Frogger created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Future improvements
* When you click really fast as the player, it doesn't remove the witch from the background because the index has already been changed.
* Instead of showing the result and ranking inside the existing grid, make a new grid and hide that at first (same as with start screen). That way, it isn't necessary to create all of the HTML elements in JS.
